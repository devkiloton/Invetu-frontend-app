## Ticker Logos Client

It's an open source Github project that allows you to get the logos of the cryptocurrencies in PNG format of all companies listed on NYSE(New York Stock Exchange) and NASDAQ(National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations).

I don't really think that this client was necessary but I wanted to make it anyway. I think it's a good idea to not have an URL isolated in the middle of the code base. So, I decided to create this client to centralize the URL that provides the logos of the cryptocurrencies.
